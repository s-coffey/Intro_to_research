# Introduction to research

This document is to provide some starting points for those beginning in clinical research, particularly focused on cardiology, using online resources. Avoid non-open source software where possible - do not use State, SPSS, GraphPad, Endnote etc. You will not have access to these when you graduate. Use the open-source alternative. 

The best course for thinking about research is Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking course and book (the 2024 version can be found here: [Statistical Rethinking 2024](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2024)). This is not an introductory course, so I would recommend in order:

1. First learn about causal inference:
   
[Causal Diagrams: Draw your assumptions before your conclusions](https://www.edx.org/learn/data-analysis/harvard-university-causal-diagrams-draw-your-assumptions-before-your-conclusions)

2. While you are doing this course, it is time to start on the outcomes of your project. At this draft stage, just put down what you know about the subject background in a few paragraphs, then start writing your methods and results. Do not stop to make this look good at this stage, do not put in citations, and do not look things up - all of that comes later, and will only interrupt the flow at this stage.  Hopefully before you have started the research, some of this will already have been done in your project proposal. Do draw a rough directed acyclic graph (DAG) of your main research question. You should have this done by the first week of the project.

3. While still doing Prof Hern√°n's course, start your literature review. Do not use Endnote as it costs money - use Zotero. If you do the literature review well enough, this can often be published separately, and especially if you are doing an intercalated MB PhD you should aim for this, as otherwise the literature review often seems quite out of date by the time you get to the time of thesis submission.

2. If you need to learn R:
